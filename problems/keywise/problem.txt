Write a program that reads in a JSON file containing mappings of users
to GitHub repositories and store them in the database such that they
can be searched.

You will be given the path to a JSON file on the second command-line
argument, you can use `require(process.argv[3])` to load it.

The JSON file is an array with rows of the form

    {"type":"user","name":"maxogden"}

for users and

    {"type":"repo","name":"mux-demux","user":"dominictarr"}

for repositories.

You should open the database path given by the first command-line
argument and write data to the database using '!' as a delimiter such
that the verify script will be able to read the repos for each user by
doing the following range query:

    db.createReadStream({ start: 'rvagg!', end: 'rvagg!~' })
