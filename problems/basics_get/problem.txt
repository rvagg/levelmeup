Write a program that opens a LevelDB data-store using `{bold}level{/bold}`.

The store will contain up to 10 entries with keys in the form:

  gibberish{italic}X{/italic}

Where '{italic}X{/italic}' is an integer between 0 and 100.

You must find those entries and print them out to the console, ordered
by '{italic}X{/italic}', ascending. You should print them out with:

  console.log(key + '=' + value)

The full path to the data-store will be provided to your program as
the first command-line argument.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
HINTS:

If there are any errors when you perform a `.get()` operation, 
your callback will receive an error object as the first argument.

Your function should be able log I/O errors to the console, but not
report on errors generated by looking for non-existent keys. You can 
identify these record-lookup errors by checking 
`err.type == 'NotFoundError'` or by checking for an `err.notFound` 
boolean.

Using `.get()` is recommended for this exercise but if you're tempted
to use a ReadStream to solve this problem, beware that the sorting
may be a problem.
