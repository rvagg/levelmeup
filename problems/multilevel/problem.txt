There is a database that beholds a secret value in our castle.

Through great efforts by the bravest of our men, it has been exposed over
the network on port `4545` - via a magical protocol called tpc - to give you
the last chance to seek and reveal one of the oldest secrets of existence,
and save our lands of fame from falling into despair!

You for sure won't be using your beloved swords and armory in this endeavour,
but a weapon that's even new to the gods: **multilevel**. Folks at
https://github.com/juliangruber/multilevel are said to know how to use it...
but take each of their words with a grain of salt!

If you still call yourself capable of being the brave one who decides our fate,
connect to the database of great treasury, and fight through the vast lands of
apis to retrieve the value that listens to "the holy secret".
